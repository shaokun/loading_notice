LoadingNotice
=============

Loading Notice is a plugin, built on Prototype, which shows an indictor when a slow AJAX is under process automatically. 
Basically, it's like the "Loading" div appears in gmail when busy. And when the users scroll or resize the window, it 
will still keep showing on the top of the page.

    <%= stylesheet_link_tag 'loading_notice' %>
